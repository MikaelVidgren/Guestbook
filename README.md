# Guestbook
Full-Stack course, Project1: Node.js site Guestbook â€“application.

Four routes: /,guestbook,newmessage and ajaxmessage.
/-route is pretty simple HTML webpage I created quickly for this course.
/guestbook loads and parses JSON-file to the page. Not sure how to format a JSON-file with bootstrap or pure.css, so the table is what it is.

Should be 5/6 points working
